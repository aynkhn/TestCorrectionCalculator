Calculator built for my math teacher to find scores after "test correction policy".

The policy states:
"Students can earn back half as many points as originally lost. For example, if a student scored a 70% on an assessment, they missed 30%. Half of 30% is 15%, so a student could raise their 70% to an 85% (70%+15%=85%)"
